# Description 
Huffman coding is a data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters in a data stream based on their frequency of occurrence. The idea is to give shorter codes to the more frequently occurring characters and more extended codes to the less frequently occurring characters to reduce the overall number of bits needed to represent the data, which leads to more efficient use of storage and a reduction in long-strings data that needs to be transmitted or stored. Huffman coding is widely used in various applications, including image and audio compression, as well as in data transmission and storage.
